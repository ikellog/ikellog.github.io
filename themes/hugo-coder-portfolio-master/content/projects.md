## a personal blog, the first steps to web dev

After some reserach on differnt CMS such as Wordpress, Drupal, & Joomla. I decided to use Hugo (a static site generator) due to it's speed; with a theme by [Yusuke Ishimi](https://naro143.github.io) (for it's clean & simple design) based on [hugo-coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder).
