In my younger days when I was playing around with the windows command prompt, I remember seeing python in the OS directory but never thought twice what it was or why it was installedâ€”I just figured it was something that made Windows XP work. It's not until now that I noticed everything connecting and the relation to things that I hadn't notice before which feels both interesting and somewhat regreftul. Also, did I mention programming is hard.
