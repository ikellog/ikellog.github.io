Throughout the years, I've read blog post and articles about programming and having now personally experiencing it--there is definitely a learning curve but like with anything new you learn--it will be hard at first; move forward and you will be rewarded with new insight and knowledge. And more importantly if you have any self-doubt, find people who can support your learning endevors.(this applies to any subject)
