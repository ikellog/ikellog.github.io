I'll start this post with a generic but hopfully motivational quote:

I've been working full-time since the completion of my bachelor’s back in 2012 and its funny to think that the only thing I wanted then, was to work. Now, having worked for all these years---school wasn’t so bad (minus the lack of $). As luck would have it, some say a recession is an excellent time to study and learn a new skill. In my case, it's Python and the world of computer science.
