      <description>Similar to playing music, if you’re not practicing daily—you forget things. This was especially true as I couldn’t remember the workflow for this blog, which is somewhat complex as it deals with Hugo, Gitbhub, and Git. After taking some time re-learning the tools, I’m finally back into it. Also, I’ve recently took an interest in technical writing—I&amp;rsquo;m set on using Antora and will have something up and running by next month.</description>

      <description>2021 comes with it the traditional New year’s resolution and some artificial motivation—had focused on learning SQL syntax and more Python in the meantime. Did I mention I think database are cool!</description>

      <description>Started a new computer science course but had slowly loss motivation due to the material’s dryness. I’m certain it’s a good course to learn despite the difficulties in staying focus—will have to get back in to in soon. Time is of the essence!</description>

      <description>While reading some technical blogs this month, I came across an interesting organization that was dedicated to the improvement of programming and problem solving. After learning more about them, I decided to apply but to my disappointment did not get in. Dealing with setbacks can be hard—just need to continue onward. The application processing was a learning experience in itself, until next time!</description>

      <description>I feel a great milestone has been reached as I&amp;rsquo;ve completed a python online course! It was both challenging and rewarding at the same time. I know there’s much more ahead of me but wanted to celebrate this achievement with a quick post. And onwards we go into the world of problem solving!</description>

      <description>Throughout the years, I&amp;rsquo;ve read blog post and articles about programming and having now personally experiencing it&amp;ndash;there is definitely a learning curve but like with anything new you learn&amp;ndash;it will be hard at first; move forward and you will be rewarded with new insight and knowledge. And more importantly if you have any self-doubt, find people who can support your learning endevors.(this applies to any subject)</description>

      <description>In my younger days when I was playing around with the windows command prompt, I remember seeing python in the OS directory but never thought twice what it was or why it was installed—I just figured it was something that made Windows XP work. It&amp;rsquo;s not until now that I noticed everything connecting and the relation to things that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t notice before which feels both interesting and somewhat regreftul. Also, did I mention programming is hard.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ll start this post with a generic but hopfully motivational quote:
 &amp;ldquo;Life is full of missed opportunities, especially if you don&amp;rsquo;t try, you&amp;rsquo;ll never know what those possibilities could be.&amp;quot;&amp;mdash;unknown
 I&amp;rsquo;ve been working full-time since the completion of my bachelor’s back in 2012 and its funny to think that the only thing I wanted then, was to work. Now, having worked for all these years&amp;mdash;school wasn’t so bad (minus the lack of $).</description>
