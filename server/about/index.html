<p>Hello there! My name is James and I&rsquo;m a Salesforce Admin/Developer. With the use of various online MOOC resources, I&rsquo;m self-taught and currently working on OSSU&rsquo;s curriculum for computer science. You can learn more about my journey on the blog section of this site.</p>

<p>After listening to a recent podcast, I was made aware of an obvious concept which I hadn&rsquo;t yet thought too much about, what is &ldquo;a Hero&rsquo;s journey&rdquo;? I realized then that I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed success stories from either famous celebrities and entertainers to successful entrepreneurs and business people. The idea of the what struggles they must have faced and how they were able to overcome them has always fascinated me&ndash;yet I hadn&rsquo;t questioned much about it. As I thought more, I realized we all have our own &ldquo;Hero&rsquo;s journey&rdquo; of struggles and failures.</p>
<p>I feel we tend to look towards people who are on the &ldquo;top of their field&rsquo; as the bar for success, and while there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with it&ndash;perhaps it makes us lose sight of the process. After years of questioning &ldquo;what I want to do&rdquo;, I&rsquo;ve finally found my answer or as least a life &ldquo;philosophy&rdquo;&ndash;that is, to set goals and strive for them. I believe it&rsquo;s the process from overcoming these challenges that should be our focus.</p>
<p>Perhaps some of us may have had a head start and had recognized it much earlier than others&ndash;yet, I feel at it&rsquo;s core, all of stoires are the same wherever and whenever we are in life. We just need to persevere forward because this is our story and we are the author of our lives. As that speaker on the podcast goes on to say, that compared with our processions&ndash;we, ourselves, and our lives are the most important asset we have.</p>
<p>This blog is my story&ndash;it&rsquo;s process and the continuum of my struggles, failures, and successes.</p>

<p>Around age 16, I was advised by my uncle to study programming. Sadly, my interest in the subject lacked passion at the time as it didn&rsquo;t have a &ldquo;cool&rdquo; factor. Ironically in retrospect, I had the markings of a &ldquo;computer science&rdquo; student and had even spent my spare time building my own desktop computer. Instead, I majored in economics because I had thought opportunity cost was &ldquo;cool&rdquo;. :)</p>
<p>In highschool, I had signed up for one of the first Dreamforce events&ndash;and was prepared to go but overslept instead. (Sadly, I did&rsquo;t learn about opportunity cost until later) My relationship with Salesforce has been ongoing for over a decade! It seems that life is in fact full of circles and not lines&ndash;it took some years but computer science is definitely &ldquo;cool&rdquo; now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always open to connect, feel free to reach me on Linkedin or Email!</p>
